# Introduction-to-Serverless
Welcome to the "Introduction to Serverless using Lambda Functions" repository! This project serves as a hands-on guide to understanding the fundamental concepts of serverless computing and how to leverage AWS Lambda functions to build efficient and scalable applications.

# What is Serverless?
Serverless architecture allows you to focus on writing code without the need to manage servers. With AWS Lambda, you can run code in response to events, such as HTTP requests, database updates, or file uploads, while leaving the infrastructure management to the cloud provider.

# Getting Started

## Clone the Repository
## cd into the folder

## Set Up AWS Credentials:
  Make sure you have AWS credentials configured (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) to deploy Lambda functions.

## Install Dependencies
  npm install

## Explore the Examples:
  Navigate to the examples directory to find sample Lambda function code and event triggers.
  Experiment with different event sources and Lambda function configurations.

## Deploy Lambda Functions:
  Use the Serverless Framework to deploy Lambda functions and their required resources:
    serverless deploy

## Test Lambda Functions:
  Invoke the deployed Lambda functions using the provided event triggers.
  Observe the serverless execution and response.
